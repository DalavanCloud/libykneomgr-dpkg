.SH EXAMPLES

To display the firmware version of a connected YubiKey NEO you use the
--get-version or -w parameter.  Typical output would be the string "3.0.4".

  ykneomgr --get-version

To display the serial number you would use the --get-serialno or -s
parameter.

  ykneomgr --get-serialno

To display the device mode you use the --get-mode or -m parameter.

  ykneomgr --get-mode

The possible modes are 0 for HID device only, 1 for CCID device only,
2 for HID/CCID composite device.  For the CCID modes (i.e., 1 and 2),
you can add 80 to enable MODE_FLAG_EJECT which means that touching the
YubiKey button will trigger eject/insert of the smartcard.  That is,
81 means CCID device only with touch eject/insert, and 82 means
HID/CCID composite device with touch eject/insert.

To mode switch the NEO into OTP-only mode, you use the --set-mode or
-M parameter with mode 0.  Note that you have to eject the YubiKey NEO
and re-insert it before it changes mode.

   ykneomgr --set-mode 0

To mode switch the NEO into CCID-only mode, you use the --set-mode or
-M parameter with mode 1.  Note that you have to eject the YubiKey NEO
and re-insert it before it changes mode.

   ykneomgr --set-mode 1

To mode switch the NEO into hybrid OTP/CCID composite mode, you use
the --set-mode or -M parameter with mode 2.  Note that you have to
eject the YubiKey NEO and re-insert it before it changes mode.

   ykneomgr --set-mode 2

To mode switch the NEO into CCID-only mode, with the touch button
acting as eject/insert of the card, you use the --set-mode or -M
parameter with mode 81.  Note that you have to eject the YubiKey NEO
and re-insert it before it changes mode.

   ykneomgr --set-mode 81

To mode switch the NEO into hybrid OTP/CCID composite mode, with the
touch button acting as eject/insert of the card, you use the
--set-mode or -M parameter with mode 82.  Note that you have to eject
the YubiKey NEO and re-insert it before it changes mode.

   ykneomgr --set-mode 82

To list the connected readers you use the --list-readers or -l
parameter.

   ykneomgr --list-readers

To list the available applets on the device you use the --applet-list
or -a parameter.  The output is a list of AIDs identifying applets.
For example, d27600012401 means the OpenPGP applet.

   ykneomgr --applet-list

To delete an applet you use the --applet-delete or -D parameter,
giving it the applet AID as an parameter.  Note that deleting an
applet may take a second or two to complete.  Warning!  Deleting an
applet will destroy all storage associated with that applet, including
any private keys or other credentials.

   ykneomgr --applet-delete d27600012401

To install a CAP file as an applet you use the --applet-install or -i
parameter, giving it the filename of the CAP file applet as a
parameter.  Note that loading can take several seconds, for typical
CAP file sizes it takes around 5 seconds.

   ykneomgr --applet-install path/to/applet.cap
.SH TROBLESHOOTING

Debug messages are printed if you pass the --debug parameter, which
can be useful for debugging or deeper analysis.

The error "No device found" can be because a number of reasons.  The
simplest, of course, is that the device really is not connected to the
machine (USB or NFC).  Another reason may be that it is in a mode
where "ykneomgr" cannot talk to it.  This can happen if the device is
in OTP-only mode (mode 0), where you must use the "ykpersonalize" tool
to mode switch it from the OTP-only mode.  It can also happen if the
device is in a MODE_FLAG_EJECT mode (i.e., 81 or 82).  If that is the
case, you must touch the button in order to "insert" the virtual
smartcard before you can invoke "ykneomgr".
